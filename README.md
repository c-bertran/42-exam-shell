### `Examshell` will allow you to practice to be perfectly ready for the exams

This one will have the same behaviors as the real examshell:
- Several exercises can be available per level, chosen randomly
- Your rendering must be committed via git
- A Moulinette will go over your code to check for forbidden functions, and possible leaks
- Then your program will be compared with the _real_ program

Some options have been added:
- Multilingual interface (currently available in `French` and `English`)
- Two difficulty:
  - `Normal`
  - `Hard`
- Two options:
  - `Infinite`: Disables the timer, so the time is unlimited
  - `Doom`: To make your practice harder, if you fail the whole rendering folder is reset, as well as the associated git

## Setup
Download the ![latest version](https://github.com/c-bertran/examshell/releases/latest) of the software. This one is available for MacOS and Linux

## How to use
Launch your favorite command prompt, and simply run the program:
```sh

```

## Exams
The following exams are available:
- Exam 02
- Exam 03
- Exam 04

## Upcoming features
Eventually, `Examshell` will allow you to create your own exams and share them with other people. This feature should be available soon

## Disclaimer
The exams available are based as closely as possible on the official exams at 42, however there may be some differences.
If you find a significant difference, don't hesitate to open an issue.
